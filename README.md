### Elevator Pitch
Introducing Convener. Have you ever had difficulties scheduling group meetings with other students on campus? How many times have you had to painfully reschedule a meeting because someone couldn't make it? Finding an acceptable meeting time isn’t so easy. Our solution is an online web app called Convener. Convener provides a beautifully simple and robust interface for inviting and accepting meeting requests. With the ability to request, notify, and accept, Convener is the only tool you’ll need to use when scheduling a meeting. A few basic features like saving preferred meeting times to a profile makes it possible to schedule meetings almost autonomously. We are certainly not the first meeting time scheduler to exist. However, other solutions don’t understand Princeton students like we do. With the simplicity of CAS login, users will be much more likely to sign in and stay signed in and get the most out of all the features Convener seeks to provide. This is great since Princeton students tend to be involved in tons of things and likely need to schedule meetings frequently and quickly. Our goal is to get wide user adoption from the student population on campus and make convening less of a headache.
